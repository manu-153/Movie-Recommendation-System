# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System – Collaborative Filtering Approac


## 📌 Overview

This project implements a **collaborative filtering-based movie recommender system** using **TensorFlow** and **NumPy**. It predicts user ratings for movies by learning from historical interactions and generates **personalized movie suggestions**.

Built on a subset of the **MovieLens dataset**, the system applies **matrix factorization** to uncover latent relationships between users and movies.

## 🚀 Key Features

* ✅ **Collaborative Filtering Algorithm** – Learns compact latent representations (embeddings) for users and movies.
* ✅ **Efficient Training with Adam Optimizer** – Leverages adaptive learning rates for faster convergence.
* ✅ **Mean Normalization** – Enhances performance for users with sparse rating histories.
* ✅ **Optimized with Vectorized Computations** – Ensures efficient large-scale matrix operations.
* ✅ **Personalized Movie Suggestions** – Delivers top unseen movie recommendations tailored to each user.

## 📊 Dataset Information

The model is trained on a cleaned version of the [MovieLens dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/), a widely used benchmark for recommender systems.

* 🎞️ **Movies**: 4,778 unique titles
* 👥 **Users**: 443 distinct users
* 🌟 **Ratings**: Floating point scores from **0.5 to 5.0** (in steps of 0.5)

## ⚙️ System Workflow

1. **Data Loading**

   * Import user-movie interaction data and metadata.

2. **Preprocessing**

   * Apply mean normalization and initialize user/movie feature matrices.

3. **Model Training**

   * Learn latent factors for both users and items.
   * Incorporate bias terms to improve prediction accuracy.
   * Apply regularization to prevent overfitting.

4. **Optimization**

   * Use **TensorFlow's automatic differentiation** and **Adam optimizer** to minimize loss.

5. **Prediction**

   * Predict missing ratings for unseen user-movie combinations.

6. **Recommendation Generation**

   * Rank and suggest the top N unrated movies for each user based on predicted preferences.
