# Movie Recommendation System using Collaborative Filtering 

## 📌 Overview  
This project implements a **collaborative filtering-based recommender system** using **TensorFlow and NumPy**. It predicts movie ratings based on user preferences and generates personalized movie recommendations.  

The system is trained on the **MovieLens dataset**, using a **matrix factorization approach** to learn latent features for both users and movies.  

## 🚀 Features  
- ✅ **Collaborative Filtering** – Learns user and movie feature vectors from existing ratings.  
- ✅ **Gradient Descent Optimization** – Uses **Adam optimizer** for efficient learning.  
- ✅ **Mean Normalization** – Handles missing ratings and improves predictions for new users.  
- ✅ **Vectorized Implementation** – Speeds up training using optimized matrix operations.  
- ✅ **Movie Recommendations** – Predicts top movie suggestions for users.  

## 📚 Dataset  
The project uses a **filtered version** of the [MovieLens dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/).  
- 🎥 **Movies**: Over **4,778** titles.  
- 👤 **Users**: **443** users with different rating preferences.  
- ⭐ **Ratings**: From **0.5 to 5** in increments of **0.5**.  

## ⚙️ How It Works  
1. **Load the MovieLens dataset** – Movie ratings and user interactions.  
2. **Preprocess Data** – Normalize ratings and set up feature matrices.  
3. **Collaborative Filtering Algorithm** – Train the system using:  
   - **User and movie feature vectors**  
   - **Bias terms for users**  
   - **Regularization to prevent overfitting**  
4. **Optimize using TensorFlow** – AutoDiff and **Adam optimizer** for learning.  
5. **Generate Predictions** – Compute expected ratings for unrated movies.  
6. **Recommend Movies** – Suggest top-rated movies for users.  

## 🛠 Installation  
### **Prerequisites**  
Make sure you have **Python 3.8+** and the necessary dependencies installed.  

### **Clone the Repository**  
1. Clone this repository.  
2. Navigate to the project directory.  
3. Run the training script to generate recommendations.  

## 📊 Example Output  
### **Predicted Top Recommendations**  
Predicting rating 4.49 for movie My Sassy Girl (2001)  
Predicting rating 4.48 for movie Memento (2000)  
Predicting rating 4.47 for movie The One I Love (2014)  

### **Original vs Predicted Ratings**  
Original: 5.0 | Predicted: 4.90 | Shrek (2001)  
Original: 3.0 | Predicted: 3.00 | Inception (2010)  
Original: 1.0 | Predicted: 1.26 | Nothing to Declare (2010)
